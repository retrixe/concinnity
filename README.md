This application currently supports watching locally stored files and remotely hosted videos (over HTTP/S). Support for YouTube videos is planned.

If you want to use concinnity with your friends, visit [concinnity.retrixe.xyz](https://concinnity.retrixe.xyz). Else, if you want to self-host concinnity, see the instructions below.

## Quick Start

- Prerequisites: You must have a PostgreSQL/MariaDB database setup, and Golang, Node.js and corepack are needed to build the application.
- To run the backend on a server:
  - Run `go build` in the `backend` folder to compile it.
  - Create a `config.json` in the same folder according to the section on [backend configuration](#backend).
  - You can now run the backend using `./concinnity` (it will run on port 8000 by default).
  - When upgrading from an older version, you can run `./concinnity --upgrade` on the first run to upgrade the database.
- To run the frontend on a server:
  - Run the `yarn` command in the `frontend` folder to install all dependencies.
  - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` according to the section on [frontend configuration](#frontend).
  - For development purposes, you can run `yarn dev` to run the application with hot reload. [For a production deployment, follow the SvelteKit instructions here.](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/building-your-app)

## Configuration

### Frontend

The frontend requires only a single configuration file `.env` to be created in the `frontend/` folder with the following contents:

```bash
# NOTE: Replace http://localhost:8000 with the correct URL that your backend is hosted at!
PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Backend

The backend requires the `config.json` file to be created in the `backend/` folder with the following options (all except `databaseUrl` are optional):

```json
{
  "port": 8000,
  "basePath": "/",
  "secureCookies": false,
  "database": "either of: postgres, mariadb",
  "databaseUrl": "see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters (postgres) or https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql?tab=readme-ov-file#dsn-data-source-name (mariadb)",
  "frontendUrl": "optional: the URL of the frontend, required for forgot password functionality",
  "emailSettings": {
    "_comment": "optional email settings for forgot password functionality",
    "identity": "optional: the identity of the email sender, defaults to username",
    "username": "the username of the email sender",
    "password": "the password of the email sender",
    "host": "the host of the email sender"
  }
}
```

The `databaseUrl` must be provided, and in production, it is recommended to make use of `secureCookies` as well. You may change the `port` as needed, and `basePath` should be modified if you are reverse proxying the backend through Apache/nginx/etc and placing the backend under another path.

⚠️ *Note:* MariaDB support *will not work* with Oracle MySQL or Percona.

## Security Practices and Reverse Proxying

If self-hosting, you should take a look at [Octyne's corresponding documentation](https://github.com/retrixe/octyne#security-practices-and-reverse-proxying), which is largely applicable to Concinnity's frontend and backend.

For further guidance, create an issue to expand this documentation.

## API Documentation

The concinnity API is currently unstable and largely undocumented. You can find limited technical information in the backend's source code (with the frontend serving as an example of a fully functional client).
